Victory Treemap
=============

`victory-treemap` draws an SVG treemap with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3). Styles and data can be customized by passing in your own values as properties to the component. Data changes are animated with [victory-animation](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-animation).

For examples, see the gh-pages branch (link)
